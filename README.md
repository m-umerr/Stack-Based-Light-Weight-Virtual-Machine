# Stack-Based-Light-Weight-Virtual-Machine

This project is an implementation of a simple virtual machine that operates on a stack-based architecture. The virtual machine executes a custom bytecode instruction set that has been designed to be both easy to use and efficient. 

The purpose of this project is to provide an educational resource for individuals interested in learning about virtual machine design, bytecode interpretation, and low-level programming concepts. 

The virtual machine is implemented in C++ and includes a simple bytecode assembler for generating custom bytecode programs. The virtual machine includes a small set of built-in instructions, including arithmetic operations, conditional branching, and stack manipulation. 

To use the virtual machine, simply compile the source code and run the executable with a bytecode program as input. The virtual machine will interpret the bytecode and execute the instructions, producing output as necessary. 

I hope that this project will be a useful resource for anyone interested in learning about virtual machines and low-level programming concepts. Please feel free to submit issues and pull requests if you encounter any problems or have suggestions for improvements.
